A scatter plot is a type of data visualization that shows the relationship between two variables. The variables are plotted on the x-axis and y-axis, and each data point is represented by a dot. The pattern of the dots can be used to see if there is a relationship between the variables.

For example, a scatter plot could be used to show the relationship between height and weight. The x-axis would represent height, and the y-axis would represent weight. Each data point would represent a person's height and weight. If there is a relationship between height and weight, the dots will tend to cluster together. If there is no relationship between height and weight, the dots will be scattered randomly.

Scatter plots can be used to identify relationships between variables, to estimate the strength of a relationship, and to make predictions. They are a versatile tool that can be used to visualize data in a variety of settings.

Here are some of the key features of a scatter plot:

* It is a type of data visualization that shows the relationship between two variables.
* The variables are plotted on the x-axis and y-axis.
* Each data point is represented by a dot.
* The pattern of the dots can be used to see if there is a relationship between the variables.

Scatter plots are a powerful tool for visualizing data and identifying relationships between variables. They can be used in a variety of settings, including research, business, and education.
