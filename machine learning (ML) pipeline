A machine learning (ML) pipeline is a series of interconnected data processing and modeling steps designed to automate, standardize and streamline the process of building, training, evaluating and deploying machine learning models. [1][2][3]

The key components of a machine learning pipeline include:

1. Data ingestion - Gathering raw data from diverse sources. [1][2][3]

2. Data preprocessing - Cleaning, transforming, and normalizing the raw data to make it suitable for analysis and modeling. [1][2][3] 

3. Feature engineering - Selecting and transforming relevant features from the preprocessed data. [1][2][3]

4. Model training - Applying machine learning algorithms to train predictive models on the prepared data. [1][2][3]

5. Model evaluation - Assessing the performance of the trained models using appropriate metrics. [1][2][3]

6. Model deployment - Integrating the trained models into production systems or applications. [1][2][3]

The main benefits of using a machine learning pipeline include improved modularization, reproducibility, efficiency, scalability, experimentation, and collaboration. [1][2][3] Pipelines help manage the complexity of the end-to-end machine learning process and enable the development of accurate and scalable ML solutions. [1][2][3]
