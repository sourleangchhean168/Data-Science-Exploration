1. Predictions and Explanations: Predictions involve making educated guesses or forecasts about future events or outcomes based on available information or data. Explanations involve providing reasoning or justifications for why certain events or outcomes occur.

2. Populations and Samples: A population refers to the entire group of individuals, objects, or events that we are interested in studying or making inferences about. A sample, on the other hand, is a subset of the population that is selected to represent the larger population. Samples are often used in statistical analysis because it is often impractical or impossible to study an entire population.

3. Parameters and Sample Statistics: Parameters are numerical characteristics or measures that describe a population, such as the population mean or standard deviation. Sample statistics, on the other hand, are numerical measures calculated from sample data, such as the sample mean or sample standard deviation. Sample statistics are used to estimate population parameters.

4. Sampling Methods: Sampling methods are techniques used to select a representative sample from a population. Common sampling methods include simple random sampling (where every individual has an equal chance of being selected), stratified sampling (where the population is divided into homogeneous groups or strata and samples are selected from each stratum), and cluster sampling (where the population is divided into clusters, and a random sample of clusters is selected for analysis).

5. Data Types: Data can be categorized into different types, such as numerical (quantitative) and categorical (qualitative). Numerical data can further be divided into discrete data (whole numbers) and continuous data (measured on a continuous scale). Categorical data can be nominal (non-numeric categories) or ordinal (ordered categories).

6. Measurement Level: Measurement level refers to the scale or level of measurement used for data. There are four commonly recognized measurement levels: nominal (categories with no specific order), ordinal (categories with a specific order), interval (numeric data with equal intervals but no true zero point), and ratio (numeric data with equal intervals and a true zero point).

7. Descriptive Statistics: Descriptive statistics involve methods and techniques used to summarize and describe data. This includes measures such as measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode), measures of variability (range, variance, standard deviation), and graphical representations (histograms, bar charts, etc.) to visualize the data.

8. Random Variables: In statistics, a random variable is a variable whose value is determined by chance. It can take on different values based on the outcomes of a random event. Random variables can be either discrete (taking on a countable number of values) or continuous (taking on values within a range).

9. Univariate and Multivariate Statistics: Univariate statistics involve the analysis and interpretation of data for a single variable. This includes measures such as mean, variance, and frequency distributions. Multivariate statistics, on the other hand, involve the analysis and interpretation of data for multiple variables simultaneously. This includes techniques such as correlation analysis and regression analysis.

10. Probability Calculation: Probability is a measure of the likelihood of an event occurring. It is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. Probability can range from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain).

11. Probability Distributions: Probability distributions describe the likelihood of different outcomes or values in a population or sample. Common probability distributions include the normal distribution (bell-shaped curve), binomial distribution, Poisson distribution, and exponential distribution. These distributions provide a mathematical framework to understand and analyze data.

12. Statistical Inference: Statistical inference involves drawing conclusions or making predictions about a population based on sample data. It involves using sample statistics to estimate population parameters and making statements about the uncertainty or confidence in those estimates.

13. Parameter Estimation: Parameter estimation is the process of using sample data to estimate population parameters. This can be done using various techniques, such as point estimation (providing a single value estimate) or interval estimation (providing a range of values within which the parameter is likely to fall).

14. Hypothesis Testing: Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make inferences about a population based on sample data. It involves formulating a hypothesis about a population parameter, collecting sample data, and evaluating the evidence against the null hypothesis (a statement of no effect or no difference). The results of hypothesis testing are used to make decisions and draw conclusions.

15. Correlation: Correlation measures the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables. It quantifies how changes in one variable are associated with changes in another variable. Correlation coefficients range from -1 to 1, with positive values indicating a positive relationship, negative values indicating a negative relationship, and zero indicating no relationship.

16. Regression Analysis: Regression analysis is a statistical technique used to model and analyze the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It helps in understanding how changes in independent variables are associated with changes in the dependent variable. Regression models can be used for prediction, explanation, and hypothesis testing.

17. Causal Inference: Causal inference involves determining whether a cause-effect relationship exists between variables. It aims to establish a causal relationship between an independent variable and a dependent variable by accounting for other possible factors or confounding variables that may influence the relationship.

These concepts and terms form the foundation of statistical analysis and are widely used in various fields to analyze and interpret data.
