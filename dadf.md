Google Earth is a computer program that provides a virtual representation of Earth through satellite imagery, aerial photography, and GIS (geographic information system) data. It allows users to explore cities, landscapes, and various locations from different angles on a 3D globe. Users can enter addresses or coordinates to navigate the globe or use a keyboard, mouse, touch screen, or stylus. Google Earth can be downloaded on smartphones, tablets, and computers.

Here are some key differences between Google Earth and Google Maps:

**Google Earth:**
- Provides a 3D representation of Earth.
- Offers a more immersive and interactive experience.
- Allows users to view cities and landscapes from various angles.
- Includes features like historical imagery, 3D buildings, and virtual tours.
- Can be used for educational purposes, such as exploring geography and history[1].
- Originally developed by Keyhole, Inc., which was acquired by Google in 2004[2].

**Google Maps:**
- Provides 2D maps and street-level views.
- Focuses on navigation, directions, and real-time traffic information.
- Offers features like search for businesses, public transit information, and Street View.
- Can be embedded into websites and apps for location-based services.

While Google Earth and Google Maps serve different purposes, they both offer valuable tools for exploring and navigating the world. Google Earth provides a more visually immersive experience, while Google Maps focuses on practical navigation and location-based services.
