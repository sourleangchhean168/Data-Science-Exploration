Here are the steps on how to become a data scientist:

1. **Learn the basics of mathematics and statistics.** Data science is a field that relies heavily on mathematics and statistics. In order to be successful in data science, you need to have a strong foundation in these subjects. Some of the topics you should focus on include:

    * Descriptive statistics
    * Probability
    * Inferential statistics
    * Linear algebra
    * Calculus

2. **Learn a programming language.** Data scientists use programming languages to analyze data, build models, and communicate their findings. The most popular programming languages for data science are Python, R, and SQL.

    * Python is a general-purpose programming language that is easy to learn and use. It is also very powerful and can be used for a wide variety of tasks.
    * R is a statistical programming language that is specifically designed for data analysis. It is very powerful and flexible, but it can be more difficult to learn than Python.
    * SQL is a database programming language that is used to query and manipulate data. It is essential for data scientists who need to work with large datasets.

3. **Learn about data collection and cleaning.** The first step in any data science project is to collect the data you need. This can be a challenging task, as you need to make sure that the data is accurate, complete, and relevant. Once you have collected the data, you need to clean it to remove any errors or inconsistencies.

4. **Learn about machine learning and artificial intelligence.** Machine learning and artificial intelligence are the two most important technologies in data science. Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that allows computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Artificial intelligence is a broader term that refers to the creation of intelligent machines that can think and act like humans.

5. **Learn about data visualization.** Data visualization is the process of communicating data through visual representations. This can be a very effective way to communicate the results of your data analysis to others.

6. **Build a portfolio of projects.** The best way to show potential employers that you have the skills and knowledge to be a data scientist is to build a portfolio of projects. This will give you the opportunity to demonstrate your ability to apply the skills you have learned to real-world problems.

7. **Get certified.** There are a number of data science certifications available that can help you demonstrate your skills to potential employers. Some of the most popular certifications include:

    * IBM Data Science Professional Certificate
    * Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate
    * Udacity Data Science Nanodegree
    * Coursera Data Science Specialization

8. **Network with other data scientists.** Networking is an important part of any job search. Attending data science meetups and conferences, joining online communities, and connecting with other data scientists on LinkedIn are all great ways to build your network.

9. **Apply for jobs.** Once you have built your portfolio, gotten certified, and networked with other data scientists, you are ready to start applying for jobs. Be sure to tailor your resume and cover letter to each job you apply for.

10. **Don't give up.** The job search can be tough, but don't give up. Keep applying for jobs and networking with other data scientists. Eventually, you will find the right job for you.
