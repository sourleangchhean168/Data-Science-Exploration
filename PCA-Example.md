The code is used to perform principal component analysis (PCA) on a dataset of survey responses. PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that can be used to reduce the number of features in a dataset while preserving as much of the information as possible.

The first step in the code is to import the necessary libraries:

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
```

The next step is to read the survey data into a Pandas DataFrame:

```
survey_df = pd.read_csv('pca_survey.csv', sep = ';')
```

The `head()` method is then used to display the first 500 rows of the DataFrame:

```
survey_df.head(500)
```

The next step is to scale the data using a StandardScaler:

```
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

scaler = StandardScaler()
preprocessed_data = scaler.fit_transform(survey_df)
```

The `fit_transform()` method on the StandardScaler object fits the scaler to the data and then transforms the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

The preprocessed data is then used to fit a PCA model:

```
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

pca_model = PCA()
pca_model.fit(preprocessed_data)
```

The `fit()` method on the PCA model fits the model to the data.

The `explained_variance_ratio_` attribute on the PCA model gives the percentage of variance explained by each principal component. The following code plots a bar chart of the explained variance ratios for the first 14 principal components:

```
pca_model.explained_variance_ratio_


plt.bar(range(1,15), pca_model.explained_variance_ratio_[0:14])
plt.xlabel('Each Component(Survey Questions)')
plt.ylabel('Percentage')
plt.show()
```

The sum of the explained variance ratios for the first 9 principal components is calculated and then plotted as a line graph:

```
sum(pca_model.explained_variance_ratio_[0:9])
plt.plot(range(1,15),np.cumsum(pca_model.explained_variance_ratio_[0:14]))
plt.xlabel('Component Size')
plt.ylabel('Percentage')
plt.show()
```

The line graph shows that the first 9 principal components account for approximately 90% of the variance in the data. This means that we can reduce the dimensionality of the data from 14 features to 9 features while losing very little information.

I hope this helps!
