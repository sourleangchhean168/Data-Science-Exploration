Data science is a multifaceted interdisciplinary field of study that uses various scientific methods, advanced analytics techniques, and predictive modeling algorithms to extract meaningful insights from data, to help answer strategic business or scientific questions in many spheres. As with any field, data science has its own set of terms and jargon that can be difficult to understand for those who are new to the field. In this article, we will explore some of the most common data science terms and their definitions, as provided by various glossaries and resources.

## Data Science Glossary by DataCamp

DataCamp provides a comprehensive glossary of common data science terms and definitions. Here are some of the terms and their definitions:

- Dataset: A collection of data of one or many types representing real-life or synthetically generated observations, and used for statistical analysis or data modeling. The data of a dataset can be gathered from many sources and is typically stored in some kind of data structure, most commonly a table, where the columns correspond to different variables, and the rows to different data entries.

- Data Structure: A way of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and worked with efficiently. Data structure defines the relationship between the data and the operations that can be performed on it. Common data structures encountered in data science are dataframes, lists, etc.

- Algorithms: A set of instructions or rules followed by a computer to solve a problem or complete a task.

- Data Visualization: The art of communicating meaningful data visually. This can involve infographics, traditional plots, or even full data dashboards.

- Machine Learning: A type of artificial intelligence that allows computers to learn from data and improve their performance on a specific task.

- Data Mining: The process of discovering patterns in large datasets.

- Big Data: Extremely large datasets that require specialized tools and techniques to analyze.

- Predictive Modeling: The process of using statistical algorithms and machine learning techniques to make predictions about future events or behaviors.

- Regression Analysis: A statistical method used to analyze the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

- Clustering: A technique used to group similar objects or data points together.

## Data Science Terms and Jargon: A Glossary by Dataquest

Dataquest provides a glossary of common data science terms and jargon. Here are some of the terms and their definitions:

- Data Science: The discipline of using data and advanced statistics to make predictions. Data science is also focused on creating understanding among messy and disparate data.

- Activation Function: A function used in neural networks to introduce non-linearity into the output of a neuron.

- Artificial Intelligence: The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems.

- Bias: A systematic error in a machine learning model that causes it to consistently predict values that are too high or too low.

- Variance: The amount by which the predictions of a machine learning model vary for different training sets.

- Cross-Validation: A technique used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model by splitting the data into training and testing sets multiple times.

- Ensemble Learning: A technique used to combine the predictions of multiple machine learning models to improve their accuracy and robustness.

- Feature Engineering: The process of selecting and transforming the input variables (features) used in a machine learning model to improve its performance.

- Overfitting: A common problem in machine learning where the model is too complex and fits the training data too closely, resulting in poor performance on new data.

- Underfitting: A common problem in machine learning where the model is too simple and does not capture the underlying patterns in the data, resulting in poor performance on both the training and new data.

## Data Science Glossary for Business by Geckoboard

Geckoboard provides a glossary of common data science terms for business. Here are some of the terms and their definitions:

- Data Analysis: Obtaining an understanding of data by considering samples, measurement, and visualization. Data analysis can be particularly useful when a dataset is first received, before one builds the first model. It is also crucial in understanding experiments and debugging problems with the system.

- Data Augmentation: A way of scaling training or inference that replicates an entire model onto multiple devices and then passes a subset of the input data to each device.

- Data Parallelism: A way of scaling training or inference that replicates an entire model onto multiple devices and then passes a subset of the input data to each device. Data parallelism can enable training and inference on very large batch sizes; however, data parallelism requires that the model be small enough to fit on all devices.

- Model Parallelism: A way of scaling training or inference that splits a model across multiple devices. Model parallelism can enable training and inference on very large models; however, model parallelism requires that the input data be small enough to fit on all devices.

- Deep Learning: A subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers to learn from data.

- Neural Networks: A type of machine learning algorithm that is modeled after the structure and function of the human brain.

- Supervised Learning: A type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on labeled data, meaning that the correct output is known.

- Unsupervised Learning: A type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on unlabeled data, meaning that the correct output is unknown.

- Regularization: A technique used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models by adding a penalty term to the objective function.

- Hyperparameters: Parameters in a machine learning model that are set before training and affect its performance, such as the learning rate or the number of hidden layers in a neural network.

## Machine Learning Glossary by Google for Developers

Google for Developers provides a glossary of general machine learning terms, plus terms specific to TensorFlow. Here are some of the terms and their definitions:

- Data Analysis: Obtaining an understanding of data by considering samples, measurement, and visualization.
